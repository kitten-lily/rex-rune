# Rex Linux: product

## Purpose

A native Linux client for [Rex](https://www.superlogical.com/rex) servers, aimed at people who do daily coding work across several machines. It attaches to server-owned sessions that other Rex clients (for example the official Mac and iOS apps) can use at the same time. Closing the client leaves programs running on the server.

## Platform and stack

Native Linux desktop (Wayland and X11). Rust, [Rune](https://github.com/anomalyco/rune) (wgpu/winit, rune-kit) and libghostty-vt.

## Principles

- **Attachment only.** The client never starts, stops or reconfigures a server, and never creates or destroys a session unless asked explicitly.
- **The server owns the terminal.** Terminal content, colours, block order and split nesting come from the server; the client draws chrome around them and never recolours output. Tiled tabs draw the server's ratios. A tab may instead use this client's local scrolling view: top-level horizontal parts become columns with persistent client-local widths while splits inside each column keep the server's ratios. Creating a column is still an explicit server split after that whole column.
- **Hosts → sessions → tabs.** Saved hosts contain sessions; a session's Rex windows are tabs and its block hierarchy is the server's. Navigation must stay useful with a dozen or more sessions across several hosts.
- **Compact and calm.** One toolbar, rounded pane cards on a flat dark ground. Popups, highlights and a scrolling tab's automatic pan animate; terminal cells never do.
- **Safe by default.** Closing a pane or tab names what will end and defaults to **Keep running**. A transport failure pauses input rather than queueing it.
- **Keyboard first.** Workspace shortcuts are reserved by the client; every other key reaches the focused terminal.

## Capabilities

Saved hosts, sessions, tabs, authoritative split order and nesting, tiled and local horizontally scrolling tab layouts with persistent widths, width presets, maximize/restore, centering and direct boundary resizing, snapshot restoration, live output, input, mouse reporting, reconnect and resume. Terminal behavior includes scrollback search, semantic text selection, OSC 52 clipboard writes, OSC 9;4 progress, bell indicators, Ghostty cursor and text decorations, box/block sprites, links and Kitty graphics. API revision 8 is used when the server offers it, with a revision-7 compatibility path. On revision 8, bootstrap bundles the initial terminal tickets; live streams and data resume take priority over new snapshots. Program activity (OSC 7501) marks tabs and, for tabs out of view, sends desktop notifications. Settings can set up Rex's skill and hooks for coding agents on this machine through the local `rex skill` command, previewing every change.

## Out of scope for now

Accessibility (AT-SPI) and distribution packages. See the README for the current list of unvalidated areas.
