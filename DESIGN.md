# Design system: Midnight

Rex Linux draws calm, dark chrome around terminals that the server owns. The tokens below mirror `src/app/theme.rs`, which is the source of truth; update both together. Midnight is the default; a build can use Rosé Pine or Rosé Pine Moon instead (`REX_CHROME`, see [Chrome palettes](#chrome-palettes)), which change colours only.

## Principles

- **The terminal is the content.** Chrome frames it and stays out of the way. Terminal text, colours, cursor and split geometry come from the server and are never recoloured; the chosen terminal theme reaches the terminal through the server. The one exception: the server's default terminal background is drawn in the theme's background (the chrome's built-in theme uses the ground's colour, so a single pane and the toolbar read as one surface) when both are equally dark or light; otherwise the server's own is kept so its default text stays readable. Explicit colours are preserved.
- **Chrome moves, content doesn't.** Popups spring open from their anchor and highlights and the sidebar slide; terminal content, pane geometry and cell rendering never animate.
- **One working row.** Session identity, tabs, commands and the window's own controls share a single toolbar. Navigation (hosts → sessions) opens on demand, with an optional sidebar.
- **Quiet when healthy.** A connected host, a live pane and an idle active tab carry no status dots or "Connected" labels; names and host icons are enough. Words appear for trouble ("Offline", "Reconnecting", "input paused"), unseen completion or bell, and terminal-reported progress.
- **Distinct states.** The current session, the keyboard-selected row, a captured pane target and live terminal focus each have a different cue. Keyboard selection is never fill alone.
- **Name the target.** Creation actions name their host; destructive confirmations name the pane, tab and host and default to **Keep running**; closing the app leaves server programs running.

## Colour

| Token | Value | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GROUND` | `#001528` | Window ground and page background |
| Terminal background | `#001528` in the built-in theme | The area behind terminal text, from the terminal theme. Pane cards, their headers and strips stay on `GROUND`. |
| `POPOVER` | `#0d1524` | Popovers, dialogs, raised surfaces (drawn at 95% over a backdrop blur) |
| `INK` | `#e8eef6` | Primary text and icons |
| `MUTED` | `#93a3b8` | Secondary text, labels, shortcuts and icons |
| `ACCENT` | `#7cc4ff` | Focus, selection outline, current-session emphasis, caret |
| `ACCENT2` | `#a78bfa` | Secondary accent |
| `LIVE` | `#5eead4` | Kit success colour |
| `WARNING` | `#f5d48a` | Reconnecting, notices, ownership strips |
| `DANGER` | `#ff8a8a` | Validation errors and destructive text |
| `ON_ACCENT` | `#061220` | Text on an accent fill (primary buttons) |
| `TERMINAL_SELECTION` | `#2f4a6e` | Local terminal text-selection overlay, when the terminal theme has no `selection-background` (its `selection-foreground`, if any, recolours selected text) |

Interaction fills are translucent white over the surface: hover 7%, pressed 11%; borders 6–20% white (focus uses `ACCENT`). Trouble states always carry a word, never colour alone; healthy states show nothing. The chrome has no light palette; a light terminal theme changes only the terminal area.

### Chrome palettes

Rosé Pine builds map the tokens onto Rosé Pine's roles; everything else (fills, borders, motion, layout) is unchanged. The built-in terminal theme of each is Rosé Pine's own (as its Ghostty theme), with `GROUND` as its background.

| Token | Role | Rosé Pine | Rosé Pine Moon |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `GROUND` | base | `#191724` | `#232136` |
| `POPOVER` | surface | `#1f1d2e` | `#2a273f` |
| `INK` | text | `#e0def4` | `#e0def4` |
| `MUTED` | subtle | `#908caa` | `#908caa` |
| `ACCENT` | iris | `#c4a7e7` | `#c4a7e7` |
| `ACCENT2` | foam | `#9ccfd8` | `#9ccfd8` |

| `TERMINAL_SELECTION` | highlight med | `#403d52` | `#44415a` |

## Typography

Chrome uses Inter (bundled with the kit) in 10–13 pt steps, weights about 450 (body), 560 (medium), 620 (strong); group labels are 10.5 pt small capitals with 0.6 tracking. The terminal font is configurable (`--font`, `--font-size`, saved size 8–48 px; default JetBrainsMono Nerd Font 15) and falls back to bundled IBM Plex Mono. Cell width follows the font's advance; ligatures and kerning are off so the grid stays exact. Names keep their case and ellipsize when space is bounded, with tooltips for the full text. Server windows are called **tabs**.

## Layout and shape

- **Toolbar:** 52 pt chip bar. Controls sit on glassy chips (10 pt radius, 5.5% white fill, gradient hairline border). Tab pills are 96–240 pt wide with no close button: a tab closes from its right-click menu, a middle-click or `Ctrl Shift W`. Commands (⌘) and New tab (+) are 34 pt icon chips on the right. A pill shows its focused pane's program icon, its label, and then a word for program activity: "Needs approval", "Question", "Needs sign-in" or "Needs input" in `WARNING`, "Error" in `DANGER`, unseen "Done" in `ACCENT`; idle and working tabs show no word. A tab still called "Shell", the name new tabs get, shows its focused pane's terminal title instead while the program that set it is in the foreground; a tab the user named keeps its name. The label truncates before the word does; the program's message is the word's tooltip. The empty space moves the window; edges and corners resize it; minimize/maximize/close are at the right end.
- **Single pane:** a tab with one pane, not zoomed, draws it edge to edge under the toolbar with no card, header, border or margin. Its exception strip floats at the pane's top-right corner.
- **Pane cards:** splits, and a zoomed pane, are server-defined placements as rounded cards (12 pt radius) with a 30 pt header (pane name and, when needed, its exception strip), 8 pt gutters and 10 pt outer margin on the ground; their border separates them from the same-coloured ground. Terminal text has 8 px padding inside its card. Divider drags preview immediately and send a ratio clamped to 0.1–0.9.
- **Sidebar:** optional; it opens at launch as it was left, at its saved width. Default 236 pt wide (200–360 pt, drag the edge to resize, double-click to reset). Host rows are 28 pt, session rows 32 pt, groups separated by 12 pt.
- **Popovers:** session/host menus anchor to the identity; pane and tab menus to the pointer (right-click), and pane menus also to the toolbar; the command menu is centered near the top. Popovers are compact: the switcher 340 pt wide, Commands 460, pane menus 260; 28 pt rows (30 in Commands), 26 pt group headers, a 34 pt search field, 5 pt padding and a 12 pt radius. Popovers clamp to the viewport; long lists scroll with directional hints that count hidden rows. A popover never opens another popover from its rows: the switcher's highlighted session row trades its detail for pencil and × buttons, and renaming turns the row itself into a field (accent outline) until Enter or Esc.
- **Dialogs** (forms, confirmation) are centered over a dark scrim and sized to their content within the viewport. **Settings** is a larger dialog (760×520, clamped to the viewport) with a 190 pt section list on the left and the section's rows on the right; each row names the setting, explains it in one muted line and puts its control on the right. Forms and confirmations opened from Settings return to it.
- **Radii:** kit small 8, medium 10; chips 10; cards and popovers 12.
- **Icons:** authored strokes on a 20×20 view box, 1.5 stroke, round caps and joins, `currentColor`. Hosts show their kind (a monitor for this machine's Unix socket, a server for a remote endpoint) in the identity chip, sidebar headers and switcher groups; tabs carry their program's icon at 15 pt (Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, Pi, Vim, Git, Cargo, SSH), or `>_` for shells and anything else. Pi and OpenCode use solid marks after their own logos, since outlines of them are unrecognisable at that size; the Commands button is ⌘. Magnifying glasses mark search fields only.
- **Elevation:** the working canvas is flat. Popovers and dialogs get a frosted fill, a lit gradient rim and a deep soft shadow.
- **Interface zoom:** 70–150% in 10% steps. Zoom above 100% is limited to preserve a 640×480 layout floor where the viewport allows; terminal font size is independent.

## Interaction

- Workspace shortcuts are listed in the README; they are reserved by the client and never reach the terminal.
- Opening a form or search focuses its first field; close confirmation focuses **Keep running**. Tab and Shift-Tab cycle fields and actions in panels; Enter and Space activate; Escape backs out and restores the previously focused pane. Tab, Space, Return, Escape and Menu never move focus away from the terminal unless a panel is open.
- Right-click captures the specific pane under the pointer; its menu names tab and pane and keeps a target outline through rename and close. A target that disappears dismisses the menu with a notice instead of retargeting.
- Size ownership is automatic: the active window owns terminal size and typing claims it. A non-owner or reconnecting terminal shows an exception strip with **Take control** or **Retry**, and never sends a resize.
- A transport failure marks affected panes input-paused, keeps their output, and never queues or replays input. Notices are toasts: errors are sticky, information leaves after about 6 seconds, and at most three notices are retained.
- Focus cues: the focused terminal uses the program-requested block, bar, underline or hollow cursor; other panes use a hollow cursor. The focused pane has an accent outline when no panel is open. Cursor blink requests stay visually steady with the rest of terminal content.
- Links open only on Ctrl+click (press and release on the same link), never on a plain click, so selecting text and clicking into programs stay unchanged. Holding Ctrl over a link underlines it in its own text colour and shows the hand pointer.

## Do and don't

- Do keep the toolbar single-row and the terminal canvas dominant.
- Do keep chrome tokens in `theme.rs` rather than hard-coding colours in views.
- Do derive overflow cues and hidden-row counts from measured content.
- Don't recolour terminal output to match the chrome, or animate terminal content.
- Don't let selecting, copying or navigating claim size ownership.
- Don't add status dots, "Connected" labels, terminal size readouts or keyboard-hint footers.
- Don't show illustrative sessions, layouts or captures as shipped runtime state.
