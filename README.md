# Rex Linux

An unofficial, independent native Linux client for [Rex](https://www.superlogical.com/rex), the terminal multiplexer from Superlogical. It is not affiliated with, endorsed by or supported by Superlogical or the Rex authors.

Rex Linux attaches to an existing Rex server. Saved hosts contain sessions, each session's Rex windows become tabs, and the server defines the terminal splits. Sessions and their programs stay on the server when the app closes, so any other Rex client can attach to the same sessions.

It is written in Rust on [Rune](https://github.com/anomalyco/rune) (wgpu/winit, `rune-kit` components) with libghostty-vt for terminal emulation, and talks to the server through the [`rexrs`](https://github.com/a10y/rexrs) control SDK.

> **Status:** early. The protocol layer, workspace, terminal rendering and input are implemented and tested against real servers, but some areas (see [Current scope](#current-scope)) still need hands-on validation, and there are no packaged releases yet.

## Features

- Multiple saved hosts, each with its sessions; session windows are tabs and splits follow the server's layout.
- Unix-socket and HTTPS/WSS endpoints (for example a Tailscale-exposed Rex server).
- A single toolbar with session identity, tabs, commands and the window's own controls. A tab with one pane draws it edge to edge; splits are rounded pane cards. Tabs close from their right-click menu, a middle-click or `Ctrl Shift W`, always behind a confirmation. Host-grouped session navigation opens on demand, with an optional sidebar (Ctrl Shift B) that starts collapsed on every launch.
- Searchable session switcher (`Ctrl K`) and command palette (`Ctrl Shift P`).
- Snapshot restore, live output, physical-layout key forwarding with dead-key composition, bracketed paste, text selection and copy, local scrollback, and mouse/wheel reporting for terminal programs. Right-click always opens the pane menu; Shift+right-click sends the click to a program that tracks the mouse, and Shift with the left button selects text locally.
- The terminal's dark background is declared to the server for every pane this client streams or creates, so programs that ask for the background colour (OSC 11) get the colour drawn behind them. Fish uses it to pick the light or dark variant of a colour-theme-aware theme.
- Reconnect handling: a transport failure pauses input on affected panes (input is never replayed) while parsed output survives reconnects and session changes.
- Program activity on tabs. Programs that report their status with OSC 7501 (coding agents, for example) mark their tab with a word when they need you ("Needs approval", "Question", "Needs sign-in", "Needs input") or fail ("Error"), and with "Done" when they finish in a tab you weren't looking at. Each tab shows its focused pane's program icon (Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, Pi, Vim, Git, Cargo, SSH; otherwise `>_`), and a tab you haven't renamed takes the title its program sets (OSC 0 or 2), as a terminal window would. Needs a server with API revision 8.
- Desktop notifications through the freedesktop notification service when a tab you aren't looking at needs you, fails or finishes, and for notifications programs send themselves (OSC 9 and OSC 777). Clicking one raises the window and shows that tab. Each kind can be turned off in Settings → Notifications.
- Agent integrations (Settings → Integrations): installs, updates or removes Rex's skill and session hooks for Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, Pi and OMP on this machine with the local `rex skill` command. OMP reads the shared `~/.agents/skills/rex` skill used by Codex, OpenCode and Pi; it does not have a Rex session hook. Every change is previewed with a dry run first, including every agent affected by that shared skill. "Let agents name sessions" is passed to every setup explicitly.
- Interface zoom (70–150%) and a configurable terminal font and size.
- Borderless window with its own minimize/maximize/close, edge resizing and drag region.
- Keys are sent by physical position (Ghostty key names), so non-US layouts work.

**Attachment only.** Rex Linux never starts, stops, replaces or reconfigures a Rex server and attaching does not need a `rex` executable. The only place the app runs `rex` is Settings → Integrations, on this machine and always with `--autostart=false`; it searches `PATH`, then `$XDG_BIN_HOME` or `~/.local/bin` for desktop launches that do not inherit the shell's path. An unavailable server is shown as disconnected and retried. Closing the client leaves server programs running.

## Requirements

- Rust 1.96 or newer (edition 2024; see `rust-version` in `Cargo.toml`).
- [Zig](https://ziglang.org/) 0.17.x. The `ghostty-vt` crate builds Ghostty's VT library from a checksum-pinned source archive with Zig.
- Linux with Wayland or X11, plus the usual graphics/input libraries: Vulkan, xkbcommon, fontconfig and the Wayland/X11 client libraries.
- A running Rex server that supports API revision 7 or 8. The client negotiates revision 8 when available and falls back to 7, including on newer servers that offer compatibility.

## Build

The repository's [`mise.toml`](mise.toml) pins Rust 1.96.1 (with Clippy and
rustfmt) and Zig 0.17.1:

```sh
mise trust
mise install
mise run build
```

Mise manages the language toolchain, not the native Linux libraries listed in
[Requirements](#requirements). With compatible Rust and Zig already on
`PATH`, the equivalent build command is:

```sh
cargo build --locked --release --bin rex-linux
```

`Cargo.lock` pins the dependency graph. TLS uses Rustls with the system trust roots. The workspace also builds two protocol probes (`rex-probe`, `rex-workspace-probe`) that do not need the UI; use `--no-default-features` to build only those.

## Run

```sh
# Create a persistent session on the local Rex server.
target/release/rex-linux --new work

# Reattach to an existing session by exact label or ID.
target/release/rex-linux --session work

# Attach to a remote server (for example one exposed over Tailscale).
target/release/rex-linux --endpoint https://my-host.example.ts.net --session work

# Choose a terminal font and size.
target/release/rex-linux --session work --font 'JetBrainsMono Nerd Font' --font-size 15
```

Options:

| Option | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `--endpoint <URL>` | `unix:///absolute/path.sock`, `https://…`, `http://…`, `wss://…` or `ws://…`. Defaults to `$REX_SERVER`, then `unix://$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/rex/server.sock` (or `unix:///run/user/1000/rex/server.sock` if `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` is unset). |
| `--session <LABEL\|ID>` | Select a session by exact label or ID. Missing or ambiguous names never pick an arbitrary session. |
| `--new <LABEL>` | Explicitly create a persistent session (conflicts with `--session`). Ordinary attachment never creates or destroys sessions. |
| `--block <ID>` | Initially focus this terminal block. |
| `--font <FAMILY>`, `--font-size <PX>` | Terminal font (default `JetBrainsMono Nerd Font`, 15) resolved through fontconfig with its ordered fallback chain. If the primary family is missing, the bundled IBM Plex Mono is used and a line is printed on stderr. |
| `--config <PATH>` | Use a separate workspace preferences file. |
| `--window-size <WxH>` | Requested startup size (default `1440x900`); tiling compositors may override it. |

Without `--session`, the workspace restores the saved host and session; on a new host it selects the first listed session. Rune's own developer flags go after `--` (for example `-- --snap out.png`). `REX_FRAME_STATS=1` prints per-frame CPU percentiles.

### User install

```sh
# Build a release binary and install it for the current user.
mise run install

# Remove the installed binary, desktop entry and icons.
mise run uninstall
```

To choose the installed desktop launcher's terminal font without committing a
machine-specific preference, add it to `mise.local.toml`:

```toml
[env]
REX_INSTALL_FONT = "Iosevka Term"
```

The variable is optional. When set, `mise run install` adds the corresponding
`--font` argument to the desktop entry; when unset, the application uses its
default family.

The install task copies `rex-linux` to `$XDG_BIN_HOME` (normally
`~/.local/bin`), installs `dev.shuv.rex-linux.desktop` under
`$XDG_DATA_HOME/applications` (normally `~/.local/share/applications`), and
adds the 32, 128 and 256 px icons to the user's `hicolor` theme. It does not
need root access or depend on the checkout remaining at the same path. The
desktop step needs `desktop-file-install`, `desktop-file-validate` and
`update-desktop-database`. See [icon provenance](resources/icons/README.md).

## Configuration

Preferences are stored as JSON in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/rex-linux/workspace.json` (default `~/.config/rex-linux/workspace.json`): saved hosts (label, endpoint, collapsed state, optional default shell), the last host and session per host, sidebar width, terminal font size, interface zoom (`ui_scale`), the corner notices appear in (`notice_position`), the activity and notification choices (`notifications`) and whether agents may name sessions (`agent_session_naming`). Use `--config <path>` to keep a separate workspace.

Settings (`Ctrl ,`, or Settings… in Commands) has Interface (zoom, sidebar, notice corner), Terminal (font size, each host's default shell), Notifications (activity in tabs, desktop notifications and which changes send one), Integrations (Rex's skill and hooks for coding agents on this machine), Remote Hosts (add, edit or remove saved hosts) and Shortcuts sections. Removing a host only stops this client connecting to it; its sessions keep running on the server. A changed endpoint connects to that server as a new host.

A host's default shell (empty means the server user's login shell) is used for every new session, tab and split this client creates on that host. Host endpoints must be `unix://` with an absolute path, or `https://`, `http://`, `wss://` or `ws://` URLs.

## Keyboard shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Ctrl K | Search sessions across saved hosts |
| Ctrl Shift P | Search commands, sessions and current-session tabs |
| Ctrl Shift N / T | New session on the active host / new tab |
| Ctrl Shift D / Ctrl Alt D | Split right / down |
| Ctrl PageUp / PageDown | Previous / next tab |
| Alt arrows | Focus an adjacent pane |
| Ctrl Shift Enter | Zoom / restore the focused pane |
| Ctrl Shift Space | Focused-pane actions |
| Ctrl Shift W | Close the focused pane, or the tab when it has one pane (asks first) |
| Ctrl , | Settings |
| Ctrl Shift B | Collapse / restore the sidebar |
| Ctrl Shift C / V | Copy selection / paste (bracketed-paste aware) |
| Ctrl Shift R | Resume the focused terminal's data stream |
| Shift PageUp / PageDown, wheel | Scroll local history |
| Ctrl + / Ctrl − / Ctrl 0 | Enlarge / shrink / reset the whole interface |

These chords are reserved by the client and do not reach terminal programs; every other key goes to the focused pane. Interface zoom changes in 10% steps (70–150%), is saved as `ui_scale`, and is independent of the terminal font size. `Ctrl =` and the numpad `+`/`−` also work.

Other interactions: click the session/host identity for grouped navigation, or right-click it for the current session's actions; in the switcher, rename a session in place (right-click its row, F2 or the pencil; Enter saves, Esc cancels) or close it with its ×; right-click a pane for actions targeting that pane; drag dividers to resize splits and the sidebar's edge to resize it (double-click resets); double-click a tab to rename it. Closing a pane or tab asks for confirmation, with **Keep running** as the default. The active window takes size ownership of a terminal automatically. On the borderless window, the toolbar's empty space moves it (double-click maximizes; right-click requests the window manager's menu on Wayland).

## Development

The mise tasks use the pinned toolchain and the repository's required Cargo
flags:

```sh
mise run test
mise run fmt
mise run clippy
mise run test-rexrs

# Run every check above.
mise run check
```

The underlying commands remain available directly:

```sh
cargo test --locked --all-features
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --locked --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings

# Protocol probes against a Rex server (endpoint optional; they create and remove their own sessions).
cargo run --locked --no-default-features --bin rex-probe
cargo run --locked --no-default-features --bin rex-workspace-probe
```

The `scripts/` directory holds integration checks; each script's docstring lists its requirements (Xvfb, xdotool, a `rex` binary, `wayland-info`, …). Some use the configured Rex server rather than starting their own: point them at a disposable server you control. Wayland checks use the running compositor; X11 checks use an isolated display.

- `revision8-check.py`: API revision negotiation and bootstrap tickets against a disposable server, optionally running the probes.
- `connection-only-smoke.py`: a missing or stale socket must never execute the Rex CLI.
- `x11-smoke.py`: real X11 events (forms, clipboard, pointer selection, key isolation).
- `rune-acceptance-x11.py`: window-corner, terminal-key and frame-CPU acceptance checks on X11.
- `chrome-spike-x11.py` (with the `chrome_spike` example): borderless window chrome on X11.
- `wayland-seat-smoke.py`: Wayland seat/resource selection on a multi-seat compositor.
- `mouse-check.py`: terminal mouse reporting with real pointer input on a private headless Wayland display.
- `readme-screenshot.py`: regenerates `docs/screenshot.png` from a private Rex server and headless compositor, with a throwaway home and prompt so no local details appear.
- `demo-record.py`: records a demo video of the app on a private headless compositor (uses the `tools/vptr` virtual-pointer helper).

## Vendored dependencies

Two dependencies are vendored with small, documented patches and wired in through `[patch]` in `Cargo.toml`:

- [`vendor/rune/`](vendor/rune/README.md): the `rune`, `rune-motion`, `rune-staging` and `procwatch` crates from `anomalyco/rune` at `100b7d9` (MIT), with dead-key forwarding and window-chrome additions for a borderless Linux window (maximize/restore, minimize, edge resize, window menu, native window icon).
- [`vendor/rexrs/`](vendor/rexrs/REX-LINUX.md): `a10y/rexrs` at `780be3f` (MIT OR Apache-2.0), plus revision-8 generated types, explicit API-revision range negotiation and preservation of an empty `attach_session_ids`.

Each patch is meant to be dropped once the corresponding upstream release has equivalent APIs.

## Current scope

Still needing hands-on validation: physical Wayland pointer gestures (move, edge resize, double-click, window menu), minimize on Wayland, multi-seat Wayland desktops, input methods beyond dead-key composition, and sustained daily use. On X11, winit has no window-menu request, so right-clicking the drag region does nothing there.

Not implemented: terminal-content search, complete Kitty graphics, accessibility (AT-SPI) and distribution packages.
